            Welcome to Archers.space! This is a work in progress, should be more in progress now that it's available at a common domain...
            
            Below, you can see some of my work history, and above I'll be linking other pet projects. 
            Currently I'm working as the in-house IT provider for a SMB in Connecticut that does full spectrum digital
            marketing. If you're a company representative that could use high-quality custom marketing engagement, see
            their website <a href="https://rebelinteractivegroup.com/" title="Rebel Interactive Group's website in a new tab." target="_blank">Here</a>,
            or in their history section below. If you're just looking to get a small website up and running and don't want 
            to break the bank, you can reach me for help by clicking the contact button below.

    <h2>Things I Find Interesting</h2>
    <p>
      I tend to spend most of my time on work, but when I have some breathing room, I like to keep up on some news in certain areas.
      If you happen to be the same level of nerd as me, or in the ballpark, maybe you'll find some of this content useful!

      <p>Of note: This is a use of the <a href="https://newsapi.org/" title="News API home page">NewsApi</a> 
      to grab tech news. It's the most recent addition and needs some refinement; currently, 
      it grabs the top 10 search results pertaining to tech news on page BUILD, 
      not serve, and would be better implemented as a front-end interactive 
      piece that makes request based on user input for what topics they want to 
      see, but hey, we'll get there.</p>
